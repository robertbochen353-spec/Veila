VeilaLight is an ergonomic, back-support pillow with an integrated mini-projector, designed to eliminate neck strain, back pain, and wrist discomfort caused by using electronic devices. 
Its multi-functional structure allows users to comfortably sit or fully recline, offering an adjustable incline from 90° to 165°. By seamlessly projecting movies and streaming content onto the ceiling or the wall, VeilaLight provides an immersive, hands-free entertainment experience in any desired posture. 
My current goal is to build 3D model for this product to apply for patent. Then I will validate market demand for this unique comfort-first solution before moving toward production and financing.
